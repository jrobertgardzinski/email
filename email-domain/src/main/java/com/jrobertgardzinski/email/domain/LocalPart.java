     * case-sensitive, and essentially none does; what the old rule produced instead was two
     * accounts for {@code Alice@corp.com} and {@code alice@corp.com}, a sign-in that answered
     * "wrong password" to the same person typing the same address with a capital, and a
     * per-(source, account) lockout counter that split across spellings — so guessing one account
     * had as many budgets as the attacker had ways to write it. Only the four big providers were
     * lower-cased, because that is where the PROVIDER-SPECIFIC rules below happen to live; the
     * lower-casing was never provider-specific at all.
     *
     * <p>The rest stay exactly as they were: gmail ignores dots and everything after a '+',
     * outlook and yahoo drop their own suffixes. Those ARE provider claims about their own address
     * space, and stating them for a domain that never made them would merge two people's accounts.
